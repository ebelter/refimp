            NOTICE:
            
            This sequence was finished as follows unless otherwise noted:
            all regions were double stranded, sequenced with an alternate
            chemistry, or covered by high quality data (i.e., phred quality >=
            30); an attempt was made to resolve all sequencing problems, such
            as compressions and repeats; all regions were covered by sequence
            from more than one subclone; and the assembly was confirmed by
            restriction digest.
