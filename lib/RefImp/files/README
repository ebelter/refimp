HTGS submissions at NCBI 
-------------------------

NCBI has set up a streamlined protocol for genome sequencing centers
of high throughput to allow them to deposit their DNA sequence submissions
to NCBI in a fast and convenient way. After consultation with a staff
member at the NCBI you should have access to an FTP account where you
will be able to deposit your submissions and pick reports outlining the
status of the processing of your files. Additional information can be
found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/htgs

This documents outlines the structure of the directories on your FTP account,
and explains the various aliases which are in use, and are related to the
HTGS processing. We also outline the general dataflow, and where you can go
to if you have any questions or problems.

Since we are constantly improving and modeling this new dataflow,
please do not hesitate to forward comments and suggestion to us.

-- Who do you contact?

Various people at NCBI are involved with the processing of HTG records,
and the best way to make sure your requests are heard is to mail to an
alias which includes all of them:

htgs-adm@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

If mail to this alias fails to generate the response you expect, please feel
free to contact our service desk directly, at:

E-mail: info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
   Tel: (301) 496-2475


-- Preparing your submission/update

The files processed through this route are Seq-submits, and can be generated
in one of many ways. Seq-submits are a class of ASN.1 files which have all
the contact information for the submittor in addition to the record itself.

Presently we have processed Seq-submits from:

1) Sequin see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/ 
2) tbl2asn see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/htgs/tbl2asninfo
 
If you need any information about what is the best way for you, please do not
hesitate to contact us (htgs-adm@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for more information.


-- Logging into your account

using any FTP client (or command line) you should be able to connect
with the login and password that was provided to you.

The machine you are connecting to is ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

    ftp to : ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
     login : <login was provided to you>
  password : <use provided password>


-- A description of each sub-directory:

Once you have logged in, you should see the following directories
with the 'ls -l' or 'dir' commands:

   1. REPORT: all the report generated from NCBI for this genome center

   1.1 ARCHRPT: reports which are more than 30 days old will be moved 
                to this subdirectory ( <home>/REPORT/ARCHRPT/)

   2. SEQSUBMIT:
      -- for the center to put the sequences files
      -- the file type is Seq-submit ASN.1
      -- the filename: clone.*, s.t. L118.ent or L118.SS

   3. TEMP: A directory for exchange of miscellaneous files as needed


-- How we process a new submission:

   1. On a daily basis (once a day) we have an program which will 
      check your "SEQSUBMIT" directory.  This runs every morning 
      (7 days a week) around 4:00AM (EDT)

   2. If there are files in that directory, we then copy the file(s)
      to the intermediate area; if none are present, then the 
      script ends here, and exits.

   3. Ten minutes later, we will check that directory again, 
      compare to the contents of the directory to the previous file(s) 
      -- if the contain of the directory is same, then for each 
      file in the intermediate area, we delete the file in
      the "SEQSUBMIT" directory, move the file from intermediate 
      area to a permanent processing area, and then start to 
      process the file(s), then script exit.
      -- if the contents of the directory are different,  we then copy
      all the files over to the intermediate area again, and repeat
      step 10 minutes later. 

This procedure ensures that no intermediate files are processed, and
that we always have the complete number of files from a given center.

   4. After we have finished processing your submissions, a report 
      is written and placed in the REPORT directory in the afternoon 
      around 6:00PM (EDT). The file name will look like:

      shgc19960614.rightDS.ent.ac4htgs       if the entry is O.K.
      shgc19960614.rightDS.ent.ac4htgs.ERR   if the entry has errors.

reports with a new accession number will look like this:

   source: pgec
    clone: YUP8H12
accession: AC000098
    phase: 1
    notes: New
   crdate: 1996-11-25
   update: 1996-11-25

   5. Please send email to "htgs@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" if you do not hear from
      us or do not see the report in the directory within two working days
      after you put the submission, or if you have any concerns about the
      processing of your submissions.


-- How we process an update:

Updates are processed the same way, deposited by you in the same directory.
The only difference that the submitted file will have the accession number
we provided to you the first time, hence we will recognize it as an update
(ie your center, clone name unique tag will match the accession number you
have in the submission, and the one we have already assigned for that clone.
Any discrepency in accession number, clone id, center name will result in
the rejection of the update. If this happens, please contact us if you do
not understand why there was a failure of the update process.

Reports from Updates will look like this:

   source: shgc
    clone: B175D10
accession: AC000013
    phase: 2
    notes: Update
   crdate: 1996-10-01
   update: 1996-10-03

We now have a change in policy on the submission citations for High
Throughput Genome records. Normally your submission has two citations.
One (we call the "Cit-sub" in ASN.1 terms) is the citation for the
submission of the data. It is attached to the submission itself and
appears in the GenBank flatfile as "Direct Submission ..." REFERENCE.
It credits the people who where involved in the sequencing of the record.
These are usually the same people as the attached scientific paper
(see below) but it does not have to.

The other citation (usually a "Cit-gen" or a "Cit-art") is the bibliographic
REFERENCE about the paper (wich may be unpublished) describing the work.

Normally, each time a sequence record is updated we add a new Cit-sub so
that over time, a user can see a revision history of the record as a series
of Submission REFERENCES with the date of each one. This is useful for
regular GenBank records which are updated rarely. Unfinished sequences
(Phase 1 or 2) get updated frequently which results in more Cit-sub then
is informative or useful for the reader. HTG unfinished sequence records
(phase 1 or phase 2) only show one Cit-sub, for the FIRST time it was
submitted. Cit-subs coming in on later updates would be ignored. This
implies that the author list on the Cit-sub will not change over time.

The bibliographic citation on the other hand, is treated the same way it
is now. It is part of the data submition, so we will always show what is
submitted. So if you change the author list on that, change from unpublished
to published (for example) your record will reflect the last version you
sent to us.

In addition to htgs-adm@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, which will allow you to contact
all the NCBI staff which are involved in HTG processing of records, NCBI
staff members will also use this address:

htgs-collab@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

which will include all contact people from the various genome sequencing
centers. Although we prefer to not have all the people from these centers
in this alias, more than one or two will ensure that messages we send out
will be received in a timely fashion by at least one person from that
center. Please send addresses you want to add to this alias to
htgs-adm@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

Please direct any questions or concerns to:
